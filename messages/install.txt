PerlTidy for Sublime Text 2
===========================
Thank you for installing PerlTidy for Sublime Text 2! Below are some quick
notes to get you started with the plugin. Please refer to:

	https://github.com/rbo/st2-perltidy

for the full documentation.

Quick start
-----------
To reformat Perl source code with PerlTidy, open your Perl file of choice and
hit Ctrl+Shift+t on Windows/Linux and Super+Shift+t on OSX.

PerlTidy will try to find your perltidy installation by looking at your PATH
settings and searching for perltidy in default installation locations.

Should this automatic detection fail, please inspect any error output on the
Sublime Text 2 console and adjust user setting "perltidy_cmd" as described in
the full documentation.

Thank You.
